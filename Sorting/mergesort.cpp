//Merge Sort in C++
// Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.
// The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) in all cases.
// The space complexity of merge sort is O(n) because we need to create temporary arrays to hold the two halves of the array during the merge process.
