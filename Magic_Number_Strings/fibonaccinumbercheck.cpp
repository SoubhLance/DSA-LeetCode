// Check if a number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence or not
// Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
// The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.
// For example, 8 is a Fibonacci number because it appears in the sequence, while 10 is not a Fibonacci number because it does not appear in the sequence.
